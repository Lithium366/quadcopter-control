# Arduino-based quadcopter

This project is in progress. I will try to make it usable for other people once completed

## What is this

This should be an Arduino-based quadcopter able to handle a GoPro camera

## Hardware

* Turnigy 9x reciever/transmitter
* 3DR Radio telemetry kit
* GY-80 10DOF sensor
* Arduino Mega 2560 R3 clone
* Ublox NEO6MV2 GPS

## Telemetry

It is expected to run telemetry using Node.js server based on HTML/JavaScript/CSS. The main idea is to make it work on MS Surface Pro 2
